# CityScan

A City Scan provides a rapid assessment of the critical resilience challenges that cities face using the best publicly available global geospatial datasets and open-source tools. The output is a package of geospatial solutions, maps, and data visualizations that integrate features of both the built and the natural environments. 

This repo is a collection of scripts and technical guidance used to create the different outputs used in a CityScan product.
