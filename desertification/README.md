# Desertification

### Convergence of Evidence layer
The Convergence of Evidence layer (https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/convergenceofevidence) from the World Atlas of Desertification is useful for viewing a convergence of reliable, global evidence of human environment interactions to identify local or regional areas of concern where land degradation processes may be underway.

### Dynamic World
The Dynamic World (DW) dataset contains near real-time (NRT) land use land cover (LULC) predictions created from Sentinel-2 imagery for nine land use land cover types. 

LULC Type	Description
Water	Permanent and seasonal water bodies
Trees	Includes primary and secondary forests, as well as large-scale plantations
Grass	Natural grasslands, livestock pastures, and parks
Flooded vegetation	Mangroves and other inundated ecosystems
Crops	Include row crops and paddy crops
Shrub & Scrub	Sparse to dense open vegetation consisting of shrubs
Built Area	Low- and high-density buildings, roads, and urban open space
Bare ground	Deserts and exposed rock
Snow & Ice	Permanent and seasonal snow cover

We can compare over two time periods the amount of non-bare ground pixels that have changed to bare gound pixels.
