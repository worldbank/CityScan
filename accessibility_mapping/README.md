## Accessibility Analysis

Accessibility analysis is a type of analysis run as part of a CityScan project. This type of analysis will measure accessibility to schools and hospitals (destinations) from populated areas. The population (origins) are derived from 100m grid blocks coming from WorldPop and the accessibility measure is the distance to the nearest facility in meters. Included is a python notebook titled 'buffalo_accessibility_analysis', which is an example accessibility analysis for Buffalo City, South Africa. Run your own analysis by following the notebook, providing the correct inputs (admin shapefile and WorldPop vector points).
